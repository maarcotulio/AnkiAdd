If the code doesn't find any phrases, it'll replace the phrase with the word you want to remember the meaning of, and the definitions are going to be the same. The base configuration is set to use the "Basic" format of adding cards.

# Requirements

You'll need to install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on. Please make sure the port that has been used in the AnkiConnect is the same in the code and the link to the localhost and you are using node in version 20.17.0. Otherwise, it's not going to work. If you want to be safe, make sure to be the same as the following image:
